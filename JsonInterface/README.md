# JSON interface

Folders includes scenerios of json exchanges such as
* Server response
    * Be careful there might be multiple ***Example_responses***, select appropriate one for the testing.
* UI requests (Flutter)

Please add/modify/delete json files depending on the specifications of the tasks using similar structure.

If you use one of the json files for your part, please specify here as a dependency, just in case if any file requires revision, we can keep track of other related parts of the program..

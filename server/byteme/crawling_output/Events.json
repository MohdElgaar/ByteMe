            "abstract":"In the face of massive influx of sensory stimulation, humans are confronted with a critical problem of selecting a subset of information, making the best use of limited cognitive capacity. Attention is the cognitive mechanism that solves this selection problem, allowing for enhancement of currently relevant information while inhibiting irrelevant information. The efficiency of attentional control, however, fluctuates within and across individuals due to many factors. In this talk, my previous research will be presented, specifically focusing on how distinct attributes of sensory input (value, relevance, salience, contexts, etc.) are integrated to optimally guide attentional deployment, and what factors determine the variability in attentional performance within and across individuals.",

            "abstract":"Practitioners are increasingly using visualizations to tell compelling stories supported by data, and continually developing novel techniques that integrate data visualization into a cohesive narrative. In response, those of us in the visualization research community have set to identify and refine design principles and to develop innovative techniques and tools. In this talk, I will present my recent research on data-driven storytelling, which focuses on empowering people to easily create data-driven stories leveraging expressive visualizations without the need for programming. I will also briefly discuss future research directions in this exciting field.",

            "abstract":"For robustness and reliability, it has long been an informal mantra that one should not lay all one's egg in one basket. Essentially, if we are performing multiple tests of a piece of software we are better off selecting more diverse inputs than if we select inputs that are more similar. However, a struggle has been to quantify this notion in a general and meaningful way so that it can be used for automated testing and analysis. By using theoretical and universal (!) measures from Information Theory this has changed and we now have generally applicable diversity measures both between pairs of inputs as well as for sets. While empirical results using these measures have shown impressive and state-of-the-art results for test selection and there have been efforts to speed them up we argue that they have not yet been much explored in a wider, but natural, set of test automation scenarios. In this talk I will present a few such scenarios and show some recent results on the powerful and general test methods that a diversity perspective can lead to.",

            "abstract":"One of the fundamental questions in Quantum Learning Theory is if we can have quantum advantage over any classical learning algorithms to learn some target concepts. Query complexity is one of popular measures to show the quantum advantage in the number of queries that must be made to a given circuit for identifying the target concepts. Oracle Identification Problem (OIP) is a problem introduced to systematically study the complexity of exact learning of Boolean functions. We introduce know results related to OIP and its related applications to various quantum computation models that exhibit quantum advantages.",

            "abstract":"Providing rich and immersive physical experiences to users has become an essential component in many computer-interactive applications, where haptics plays a centrol role. However, as with other sensory modalities, modeling and rendering good haptic experiences with plausible physicality is a very demanding task in terms of the cost associated with modeling and authoring, not to mention the cost for development. No general and wide-used solutions exist yet for that; most designers and developers rely on their in-house programs, or even worse, manual coding. This talk will introduce the basic concepts of haptics and the research conducted by the speaker in order to facilitate the authoring of haptic. The latter will consist of three parts: 1) Manual authoring paradigms for easier and faster synthesis of vibrotactile effects; 2) Automatic synthesis algorithms of vibrotactile effects from video and sound; and 3) Automatic synthesis algorithms of motion effects from from video and sound.",

            "abstract":"This talk introduces state and perspective of soft human-machine interfaces based on personal research experience. Recently, with the emergence of flexible devices including stretchable/bendable consumer electronic devices, wearable devices and soft electromechanical machines allowing them to be mechanically robust against deformation, user interfaces are also required to be soft to be embedded into the systems. Particularly, in the case of designing an interactive user experience interface responding to user intention, sensing components for detecting user intention and responding components providing user experience need to be considered together with interaction schemes. In the area of sensor development, thin film sensors detecting amounts of strain, bending and contact pressure have been investigated for a long time. However, the stability of sensing response under dynamically deformed conditions still remains a critical issue to be solved, although many flexible tactile sensors have been suggested. The soft tactile sensors, which are stable under conditions of dynamic bending, curvilinear surface and water environment, may to enhance the practical applicability to wearable input interfaces, artificial skin for a robot, input interface of a flexible display and etc. In the area of soft actuators, electroactive polymers (EAPs) have been proposed as one of powerful materials for implementing flexible actuation mechanism. Owing to attractive benefits of light-weight, flexibility, non-geometric constraints, cost effectiveness, and easy miniaturization, the soft EAP actuators configured to a thin film are capable of enlarging their potentials to tactile feedback interfaces for flexible touchscreen, Braille devices, and wearable tactile devices. Recently, the soft actuators have contributed to opening up many opportunities in artificial muscles, biomimetic robots, and small mechanical devices as well as tactile interfaces. In addition, soft components have a major advantage in reconfigurability. For example, a soft actuating film can change its form from flat to locally protrusive in order to simulate a physical button. A transparent soft actuator, which has a shape of a lens, can be used for varying its focal length by itself for adaptive optical systems. This talk also includes practical application of soft human-machine interfaces based on collaboration with industry partners.",

Every day hundreds of millions of users share conversations on random thoughts, emotional expressions, political news, and social issues. Users interact by following each other's updates and passing along interesting pieces of information to their friends. Information therefore can diffuse widely and quickly through social links. Information propagation in networks like Twitter and Facebook is unique in that traditional media sources and word-of-mouth propagation coexist. The availability of digitally-logged propagation events in social media help us better understand how user influence, tie strength, repeated exposures, conventions, and various other factors come into play in the way people generate and consume information in the modern society.
